# Upgrade Catalog

This document outlines the implementation architecture for the upgrade system in 33 Duels, as specified in design.md.

## Overview

Upgrades are the core mechanic that drives strategic depth and build variety. Players accumulate 33 upgrades over the course of their run, with opponents receiving the same number of randomly assigned upgrades for balanced but unpredictable encounters.

## Upgrade Categories

### 1. Weapons - Child Entities with Blueprints üî´

**Strategy**: Ranged weapons using particle spawn system for spectacular visual effects. Inspired by Liero classics.

- **Flamethrower** ‚úÖ _(Uncommon)_ - Emits a cone of flame particles that damage enemies
- **Minigun** ‚úÖ _(Rare)_ - High rate of fire bullet spray with ejecting shell casings
- **Shotgun** ‚úÖ _(Common)_ - Spread shot ranged weapon with multiple projectiles
- **Explosives** ‚úÖ _(Common)_ - Thrown bombs that explode on timeout with debris particles
- **Spikeballs** ‚úÖ _(Common)_ - Bouncing projectiles that persist and ricochet around the arena
- **Rifle** ‚úÖ _(Common)_ - High-damage, long-range precision weapon with muzzle flash
- **Mortar** ‚úÖ _(Uncommon)_ - High-arc explosive shells with area damage
- **Larpa** ‚úÖ _(Rare)_ - Rockets leaving falling particle damage trails
- **Chiquita Bomb** ‚úÖ _(Rare)_ - Bomb spawning multiple banana sub-bombs
- **Hoover Crack** ‚úÖ _(Rare)_ - Spinning particle emitter dealing continuous damage
- **Boomerang** ‚úÖ _(Uncommon)_ - Returning projectile that deals damage on the way out and back

**Implementation**:

- Weapons as child entities using `spatial_node2d()` attachment
- Particle effects via `spawn()` component with `blueprint_*_particle()`
- Weapon stats via `weapon_ranged()` component
- Complex behaviors: timeout explosions, bouncing, area effects, trails
- Visual impact: Every weapon creates spectacular particle displays

### 2. Companions - Root Entities with Blueprints üê±

**Strategy**: Cat companions that fight alongside the owner using pure component combinations - each cat's unique behavior emerges from creative stat and component combinations without special-case logic.

- **Mr. Black** ‚úÖ _(Rare)_ - Cat summoner - Spawns random companion cats every 8 seconds using spawn system
- **Mr. Orange** ‚úÖ _(Common)_ - Whirlwind barbarian - Ultra-high speed with lightning-fast retargeting creates frenzied combat
- **Mr. Pink** ‚úÖ _(Common)_ - Boomerang marksman - Equipped boomerang weapon with slow methodical movement and high patience
- **Mr. White** ‚úÖ _(Uncommon)_ - Defensive tank - Highest HP, slowest speed, equipped shotgun, waits for enemies to approach
- **Mr. Brown** ‚úÖ _(Uncommon)_ - Loyal bodyguard - Ultra-low aggression, targets friendlies to stay close and protect allies
- **Mr. Blue** ‚úÖ _(Common)_ - Mortar artillery - Glass cannon with mortar weapon, fastest targeting for rapid bombardment
- **Mr. Gray** ‚úÖ _(Rare)_ - Shadow assassin - High speed, shadow trail ability for hit-and-run attacks
- **Mr. Red** ‚úÖ _(Uncommon)_ - Suicide bomber - Dies in one hit, fast approach, explodes on death

**Implementation**:

- **Pure Component Design** - Zero new systems needed, all behaviors from existing components
- **Team-based targeting** via `IsPlayer` inheritance (3-line change to existing systems)
- **Personality traits** - Unique Aggressiveness/Patience values create distinct behaviors
- **80% system reuse** - Uses existing AI, weapon, health, and rendering systems unchanged
- **Emergent complexity** - Simple stat variations create diverse, complex behaviors
- **Multiple companions** allowed for strategic synergies and cat army builds

**Rarity Distribution** (49 Total - Tiered upgrades span multiple rarities):

- **Common**: 5 base upgrades + 20 Tier 1 tiered = 25 total common options
- **Uncommon**: 10 base upgrades + 22 Tier 2 tiered = 32 total uncommon options
- **Rare**: 34 base upgrades + 22 Tier 3 tiered = 56 total rare options

**Note**: Tiered upgrades appear at multiple rarity levels, with some high-tier upgrades like Mirror Armor and Last Stand starting at Uncommon/Rare for their Tier 1 versions. This creates 113 total upgrade options across all tiers.

**Current Implementation Strategy**:

```typescript
// Simplified upgrade categories (src/upgrades/types.ts)
export enum UpgradeCategory {
    Weapon = "Weapon", // Child entities with blueprints (11 upgrades ‚úÖ)
    Companion = "Companion", // Root entities with blueprints (8 upgrades ‚úÖ)
    Enhancement = "Enhancement", // ControlAi property modifications (31 upgrades ‚úÖ)
    Special = "Special", // Unique mechanics that don't fit patterns (1 upgrade ‚úÖ)
}
```

**Key Design Principles**:

1. **Balanced Categories**: Each category offers different strategic approaches
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Every upgrade should feel impactful and change gameplay
3. **Synergies**: Upgrades from different categories should combine interestingly
4. **Visual Feedback**: All upgrades should have clear visual/audio indicators
5. **Cat Theme**: Companions are all cats fitting the game jam theme
