# Upgrade System Design

This document outlines the implementation architecture for the upgrade system in 33 Duels, as specified in design.md.

## Overview

Upgrades are the core mechanic that drives strategic depth and build variety. Players accumulate 33 upgrades over the course of their run, with opponents receiving the same number of randomly assigned upgrades for balanced but unpredictable encounters.

## Complete Upgrade Categories (53 Total)

### 1. Weapons (11 upgrades) - Ranged Focus with Particle Effects ‚úÖ

**Strategy**: Ranged weapons using particle spawn system for spectacular visual effects. Inspired by Liero classics.

**Ranged Weapons** (11):

- **Flamethrower** ‚úÖ - Fire cone with persistent flame particles
- **Minigun** ‚úÖ - High rate of fire bullet spray with shell casing particles
- **Shotgun** ‚úÖ - Multi-pellet spread with spark particles
- **Explosives** ‚úÖ - Thrown bombs that explode on timeout with debris
- **Spikeballs** ‚úÖ - Bouncing projectiles which persist until timeout
- **Sniper Rifle** ‚úÖ - Powerful high precision rifle with long reload
- **Mortar** ‚úÖ - High-arc shells that explode on contact/timeout
- **Larpa** ‚úÖ - Rockets leaving falling particle damage trails
- **Chiquita Bomb** ‚úÖ - Timeout bomb spawning multiple banana sub-bombs
- **Hoover Crack** ‚úÖ - Spinning particle emitter dealing continuous damage
- **Boomerang** ‚úÖ - Returning projectile that deals damage on the way out and back

**Removed Melee Weapons**:

- Battle Axe, Baseball Bat, Chainsaw (moved to traits/abilities as combat modifiers)

**Implementation**:

- Weapons as child entities using `spatial_node2d()` attachment
- Particle effects via `spawn()` component with `blueprint_*_particle()`
- Weapon stats via `weapon_ranged()` component
- Complex behaviors: timeout explosions, bouncing, area effects, trails
- Visual impact: Every weapon creates spectacular particle displays

### 2. Armor/Defense (10 upgrades) - Component Enhancement ‚úÖ

**Strategy**: Enhanced Health component with armor properties + centralized damage processing.

**Current Implemented** (4):

- Scrap Armor - Ignores first damage instance
- Spiked Vest - Reflects 1 damage back to attacker
- Ablative Plating - Absorbs first 2 damage, then provides 25% reduction
- 25% Damage Reduction - Reduces all incoming damage

**New Additions** (6):

- **Shield Generator** - Absorbs next 3 damage, then breaks (renewable on kill)
- **Reactive Plating** - Damage reduction increases with consecutive hits (25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 75%)
- **Berserker Armor** - Take 50% more damage but deal 100% more damage
- **Regenerative Mesh** - Slowly heal 1 HP every 3 seconds during combat
- **Mirror Armor** - 100% reflect damage but you take 50% of reflected amount
- **Proximity Barrier** - Reduce damage from enemies within melee range by 40%

**Implementation**:

- Enhanced `Health` component with armor properties
- New `sys_health` system for centralized damage processing
- Damage accumulation pattern (systems write to `PendingDamage[]`)
- Armor effects stack multiplicatively

### 3. Abilities (11 upgrades) - System Integration & Event Hooks

**Strategy**: New components for ability tracking + system modifications for ability effects.

**Passive Abilities** (9):

- **Ricochet** - Bullets bounce once off arena walls
- **Shadow Trail** - Movement leaves damaging trail behind you
- **Piercing Shots** - Projectiles go through first enemy and continue
- **Double Shot** - Fire an additional projectile with each attack
- **Vampiric** - Heal 1 HP for every 2 damage you deal
- **Phase Walk** - Brief invincibility when dashing (0.3s)
- **Battle Axe Mastery** - Melee attacks deal +2 damage and have wider arc
- **Baseball Bat Swing** - Melee attacks knock back enemies 2x distance
- **Chainsaw Fury** - Melee attacks hit 3 times rapidly with DOT effect

**Triggered Abilities** (2):

- **Second Wind** - When reaching 1 HP, instantly heal to 50% max HP (once per fight)
- **Shock Wave** - Hitting an enemy while dashing releases a damaging shock wave

**Implementation**:

- New component: `com_abilities.ts` to track active abilities
- System hooks: Check abilities in relevant systems (combat, movement, etc.)
- Event system: Use existing action dispatch for ability triggers
- New system: `sys_abilities.ts` for ability-specific logic

### 4. Traits (13 upgrades) - Combat Enhancement ‚ö°

**Strategy**: Direct combat stat modifications and behavioral changes with clear benefits.

**Speed Traits** (4):

- **Lightning Reflexes** - +50% movement speed and dash speed
- **Quick Draw** - +40% attack speed (faster weapon cooldowns)
- **Adrenaline Rush** - +30% speed when below 50% health
- **Momentum** - Speed increases with consecutive hits (+10% per hit, max 50%)

**Health Traits** (3):

- **Vitality Boost** - +3 maximum health
- **Regeneration** - Heal 1 HP every 5 seconds during combat
- **Last Stand** - Take 50% less damage when at 1 HP

**Behavior Traits** (6):

- **Berserker** - +100% aggressiveness, +50% damage, -1 max health
- **Assassin** - Lower aggressiveness but first attack each fight deals double damage
- **Brawler** - Higher aggressiveness, shorter dash range but +1 damage to melee attacks
- **Combo Fighter** - Every 3rd consecutive hit deals double damage
- **Berserker Mode** - +50% attack speed and movement when below 25% HP
- **Revenge Strike** - Next attack deals double damage after taking damage

**Implementation**:

- Direct modifications to movement speed, attack rates, health, and damage
- Clear positive effects that players can immediately feel
- Behavioral traits modify aggressiveness with tangible benefits

### 5. Companions (8 upgrades) - Cat Allies üê±

**Strategy**: Reuse existing AI, weapon, and health systems with creative stat combinations and minor behavioral tweaks.

**Companion Cats** (8):

| Cat        | HP  | Speed | Aggressiveness | Patience | Role           | Weapon       |
| ---------- | --- | ----- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Mr. Black  | 4   | 2.5   | 1.8            | 1.5      | Elite Fighter  | None         |
| Mr. Orange | 3   | 3.0   | 2.0            | 0.5      | Fast Melee     | None         |
| Mr. Pink   | 3   | 2.0   | 1.2            | 1.0      | Sniper         | Sniper Rifle |
| Mr. White  | 5   | 1.5   | 0.5            | 2.0      | Tank           | Shotgun      |
| Mr. Brown  | 3   | 1.8   | 0.3            | 2.5      | Support Healer | None         |
| Mr. Blue   | 4   | 2.2   | 1.0\*          | 1.0      | Berserker      | None         |
| Mr. Gray   | 3   | 2.5   | 1.5            | 1.0      | Stealth        | None         |
| Mr. Red    | 2   | 2.0   | 1.8            | 0.5      | Sacrifice      | None         |

- **Mr. Black** - Most powerful, disables 2 random enemy upgrades for the fight (special ability)
- **Mr. Orange** - Fast melee: Aggressiveness=2.0, MoveSpeed=3.0, Health=3, Battle Axe weapon
- **Mr. Pink** - Ranged sniper: Aggressiveness=1.2, MoveSpeed=2.0, Health=3, Pistol weapon
- **Mr. White** - Tank: Aggressiveness=0.5, MoveSpeed=1.5, Health=5, high weapon damage
- **Mr. Brown** - Support healer: Periodically retargets owner for healing "attacks"
- **Mr. Blue** - Berserker: Aggressiveness increases when Health < 50%
- **Mr. Gray** - Stealth: Brief invisibility phases (render alpha changes)
- **Mr. Red** - Sacrifice: Spawns explosion particles on death

**Reusable Systems Architecture**:

**‚úÖ Zero Modifications Needed:**

- `sys_control_ai` - Handles all movement and combat AI
- `sys_weapon_*` - Cat attacks use existing weapon systems
- `sys_health` - Cat death/damage processing
- `sys_move`, `sys_render2d` - Physics and rendering
- All collision and particle systems

**üîß Minimal Extensions Required:**

**1. Team Targeting** (5-line change to `sys_aim.ts`):

```typescript
// In find_nearest_enemy(): Skip entities with same IsPlayer value
let other_ai = game.World.ControlAi[other];
if (other_ai && other_ai.IsPlayer === my_ai.IsPlayer) continue; // Same team!
```

**2. Cat Blueprints** (creative stat combinations):

```typescript
// blueprint_mr_orange(): Fast melee fighter
control_ai(owner.IsPlayer, 3.0), // Inherit team, high speed
health(3), move2d(3.0),
blueprint_battle_axe(), // Attach weapon as child
// Aggressiveness=2.0, Patience=0.5 in AI component

// blueprint_mr_white(): Tank with powerful ranged
control_ai(owner.IsPlayer, 1.5), // Inherit team, slow
health(5), move2d(1.5),
blueprint_sniper_rifle(), // High-damage weapon
// Aggressiveness=0.5, Patience=2.0
```

**3. Special Behaviors** (system hooks):

- **Mr. Brown Healing**: Periodically switch `aim.TargetEntity` to owner
- **Mr. Blue Berserker**: Modify `ai.Aggressiveness` when health drops
- **Mr. Red Explosion**: Spawn explosion particles in death handler
- **Mr. Gray Stealth**: Modify render alpha in phases

**4. Companion Management** (upgrade system):

- Spawn cat when companion upgrade applied
- Allow multiple companions for synergistic gameplay
- Remove companions when owner dies

**Cat Mechanics**:

- **Team Allegiance**: Cats inherit `IsPlayer` from owner (automatic enemy targeting)
- **Personality Traits**: Each cat has unique Aggressiveness/Patience values
- **Visual Distinction**: Different sprites, colors, sizes via render components
- **Death Synchronization**: Companions die when owner dies
- **Multiple Companions**: Players can have multiple cats for interesting synergies:
    - Mr. Pink (sniper) + Mr. White (tank) = ranged support + front-line protection
    - Mr. Orange (fast melee) + Mr. Brown (healer) = aggressive attacker + sustain support
    - Mr. Blue (berserker) + Mr. Red (sacrifice) = explosive damage combinations

**Implementation Benefits**:

- **80% System Reuse**: Movement, combat, health, rendering all work unchanged
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple stat variations create diverse behaviors
- **Minimal Code**: ~50 lines for team logic + cat blueprints vs hundreds for new systems
- **Performance**: No new system overhead, just more entities with existing components
- **Hackability**: Easy to add new cat types or modify existing ones

## Upgrade Distribution Summary

**Total Upgrades: 53** (Player will see 33 out of 53 in a single run)

- **Weapons**: 11 upgrades
- **Armor/Defense**: 10 upgrades (4 implemented + 6 new)
- **Abilities**: 11 upgrades (9 passive + 2 triggered)
- **Traits**: 13 upgrades (4 speed + 3 health + 6 behavior)
- **Companions**: 8 upgrades (Mr. Black, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, etc.)

**Implementation Strategy**:

```typescript
// Updated upgrade categories (src/upgrades/types.ts)
export const enum UpgradeCategory {
    Weapon = "weapon",
    Armor = "armor",
    Ability = "ability",
    Trait = "trait",
    Companion = "companion", // Replaces "special"
}
```
