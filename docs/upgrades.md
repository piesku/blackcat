# Upgrade System Design

This document outlines the implementation architecture for the upgrade system in 33 Duels, as specified in design.md.

## Overview

Upgrades are the core mechanic that drives strategic depth and build variety. Players accumulate 33 upgrades over the course of their run, with opponents receiving the same number of randomly assigned upgrades for balanced but unpredictable encounters.

## Implementation Categories

### 1. Weapons - Child Entity Approach âœ…

**Strategy**: Implement weapons as child entities attached to fighters.

**Benefits**:

- Clean separation of weapon logic
- Easy to add/remove dynamically
- Natural parent-child relationship for positioning
- Weapon-specific components (damage, range, cooldown)

**Examples**:

```typescript
// Weapon blueprints as child entities
weapon_battle_axe(parent_entity); // Melee weapon, short range, high damage
weapon_pistol(parent_entity); // Projectile weapon, spawns bullets
weapon_baseball_bat(parent_entity); // Melee with knockback effect
weapon_throwing_knives(parent_entity); // Multiple projectiles with spread
```

**Implementation**:

- Weapons trigger during AI `AIState.Attacking`
- Child entity inherits parent's transform
- Weapon components: `WeaponMelee`, `WeaponRanged`, `WeaponStats`
- Combat system checks for weapon children during attacks

### 2. Armor/Defense - Component Enhancement âœ…

**Strategy**: Enhanced Health component with armor properties + centralized damage processing.

**Benefits**:

- Minimal ECS overhead
- Direct integration with existing combat system
- Easy to stack multiple armor effects
- Centralized damage processing via `sys_health`

**Implemented Armor Types**:

```typescript
// Application functions in src/upgrades/armor.ts
apply_scrap_armor(game, entity); // Ignores first damage instance
apply_spiked_vest(game, entity, 1); // Reflects 1 damage back
apply_bonus_hp(game, entity, 2); // +2 HP upgrade
apply_damage_reduction(game, entity, 0.25); // 25% damage reduction
```

**Implementation**:

- âœ… Enhanced `Health` component with armor properties
- âœ… New `sys_health` system for centralized damage processing
- âœ… Damage accumulation pattern (systems write to `PendingDamage[]`)
- âœ… Four armor types implemented and tested

### 3. Abilities - System Integration & Event Hooks

**Strategy**: New components for ability tracking + system modifications for ability effects.

**Benefits**:

- Flexible system for complex interactions
- Can modify any game system behavior
- Event-driven architecture for triggered abilities

**Categories**:

#### Passive Abilities

- Always active, modify system behavior
- Examples: "Ricochet" (bullets bounce), "Shadow Trail" (movement leaves damage)

#### Triggered Abilities

- Activate on specific events (damage taken, HP threshold, etc.)
- Examples: "Last Stand" (deal damage when dying), "Berserker" (speed up at low HP)

**Examples**:

```typescript
interface AbilityInventory {
    Passive: AbilityType[];
    Triggered: AbilityType[];
}

// Ability implementations
ability_last_stand(); // Modifies combat system on death
ability_ricochet(); // Modifies projectile physics system
ability_shadow_trail(); // Adds trail rendering + damage zones
ability_berserker(); // Modifies movement speed based on health
```

**Implementation**:

- New component: `com_abilities.ts` to track active abilities
- System hooks: Check abilities in relevant systems (combat, movement, etc.)
- Event system: Use existing action dispatch for ability triggers
- New system: `sys_abilities.ts` for ability-specific logic

### 4. Companions - Independent AI Entities

**Strategy**: Spawn separate AI-controlled entities that fight alongside the owner.

**Benefits**:

- Reuse existing AI fighter system
- Natural team-based combat
- Can have their own weapons/abilities

**Examples**:

```typescript
// Companion blueprints
companion_feral_dog(owner_entity); // Fast, low HP, aggressive AI
companion_attack_rat(owner_entity); // Very fast, very low HP, swarm tactics
companion_moose(owner_entity); // Slow, high HP, high damage
```

**Implementation**:

- Extend AI system with "team" concept
- Companions target enemies of their owner
- Companions die when owner dies (or have limited lifespan)
- Visual indicators showing ownership relationship

### 5. Special/Thematic - Custom Systems

**Strategy**: Unique implementations for signature upgrades.

**Black Cat Example**:

```typescript
ability_black_cat() {
    // Spawns cat entity that runs across arena
    // On collision with opponent, disables 50% of their upgrades
    // Temporary effect lasting the current duel only
}
```

## Proposed Core Architecture

### New Components

```typescript
// Weapon union type with discriminated union
export const enum WeaponKind {
    Melee,
    Ranged,
}

export interface WeaponMelee {
    Kind: WeaponKind.Melee;
    Damage: number;
    Range: number;
    Cooldown: number;
    LastAttackTime: number;
    Knockback: number;
    Arc: number; // Attack arc in radians
}

export interface WeaponRanged {
    Kind: WeaponKind.Ranged;
    Damage: number;
    Range: number;
    Cooldown: number;
    LastAttackTime: number;
    ProjectileSpeed: number;
    ProjectileCount: number;
    Spread: number; // Spread angle in radians
}

export type Weapon = WeaponMelee | WeaponRanged;

// Game state
export interface GameState {
    currentLevel: number; // 1-33 duels
    playerUpgrades: UpgradeType[]; // Player's accumulated upgrades
    population: number; // Narrative countdown (8 billion -> 1)
    isNewRun: boolean; // Fresh start vs resumed
}

// Enhanced health for armor (IMPLEMENTED)
interface Health {
    Max: number;
    Current: number;
    LastDamageTime: number;
    IsAlive: boolean;

    // Armor properties
    IgnoreFirstDamage?: boolean; // Scrap Armor - ignores first damage instance
    ReflectDamage?: number; // Spiked Vest - reflects damage back to attacker
    DamageReduction?: number; // Reinforced Plating - percentage damage reduction
    FirstDamageIgnored?: boolean; // Internal flag for Scrap Armor

    // Damage accumulation system
    PendingDamage: DamageInstance[];
}

interface DamageInstance {
    Amount: number;
    Source: number; // Entity ID that caused the damage
    Type?: string; // Optional damage type for special effects
}
```

### New Systems

```typescript
// IMPLEMENTED
apply_upgrades(game, entity, upgrades); // Applies upgrades to an entity (src/upgrades/manager.ts)
sys_weapons(game, delta); // Handles weapon activation and cooldowns âœ…
sys_health(game, delta); // Centralized damage processing with armor calculations âœ…

// TODO
sys_abilities(game, delta); // Processes ability effects and triggers
sys_companions(game, delta); // Manages companion AI and lifecycle
```

## Implementation Status

- âœ… Apply armor effects before damage calculation (`sys_health`)
- âœ… Damage accumulation pattern (write to `PendingDamage[]`, processed by `sys_health`)
- âœ… Weapon activation during `AIState.Attacking`
- TODO: Trigger abilities on combat events
- TODO: Handle companion targeting and damage

### AI System Extensions âœ…

- âœ… Weapon usage during attack state (implemented in `sys_weapons`)
- TODO: Ability-aware decision making
- TODO: Companion coordination
- TODO: Team-based targeting

### Rendering Enhancements

- âœ… Weapon attachment and animation (weapons are child entities with transforms)
- TODO: Ability visual effects (trails, auras, etc.)
- TODO: Companion visual distinction
- TODO: Upgrade UI indicators

## Questions for Implementation

1. âœ… **Weapon Activation**: Weapons activate during `AIState.Attacking` (implemented)
2. **Ability Stacking**: How do multiple instances of the same ability interact?
3. **Upgrade Removal**: Do we need temporary upgrade disabling (for Black Cat effect)?
4. **Performance**: How many total entities can we support with companions + weapons?
5. **Balancing**: Should upgrades have rarity tiers or power scaling?
6. âœ… **Armor Stacking**: Multiple armor effects stack multiplicatively (implemented)

## Next Steps

âœ… **Phase 1 & 2 Complete**: Weapons and armor systems are fully implemented and tested.

Next priority is **Phase 3: Advanced Features**:

1. **Triggered Abilities** - Implement abilities that activate on specific events
    - Last Stand (deal damage when dying)
    - Berserker (speed increase at low HP)
    - Component: `com_abilities.ts` with passive/triggered ability tracking

2. **Companions** - AI allies that fight alongside the owner
    - Extend AI system with team concept
    - Companion blueprints (feral dog, attack rat, moose)
    - Team-based targeting logic

3. **Complex Abilities** - Physics-modifying abilities
    - Ricochet (bullet bouncing)
    - Shadow Trail (movement damage zones)
    - System hooks for ability effects

The foundation is solid - proceed with abilities as the next major feature.
