# Upgrade System Design

This document outlines the implementation architecture for the upgrade system in 33 Duels, as specified in design.md.

## Overview

Upgrades are the core mechanic that drives strategic depth and build variety. Players accumulate 33 upgrades over the course of their run, with opponents receiving the same number of randomly assigned upgrades for balanced but unpredictable encounters.

## Complete Upgrade Categories (48 Total)

### 1. Weapons (10 upgrades) - Child Entity Approach ‚úÖ

**Strategy**: Implement weapons as child entities attached to fighters.

**Current Implemented** (6):

- Battle Axe - Melee weapon, short range, high damage
- Baseball Bat - Melee with knockback effect
- Pistol - Single projectile weapon
- Shotgun - Multiple projectiles with spread
- Sniper Rifle - High damage, long range
- Throwing Knives - Multiple projectiles with spread

**New Additions** (4):

- **Chainsaw** - Continuous damage melee weapon with DOT (damage over time) effect
- **Flamethrower** - Ranged weapon creating fire zones that persist
- **Crossbow** - Piercing projectile that goes through multiple enemies
- **Boomerang** - Returns to thrower, can hit on both paths

**Implementation**:

- Weapons trigger during AI `AIState.Attacking`
- Child entity inherits parent's transform
- Weapon components: `WeaponMelee`, `WeaponRanged`, `WeaponStats`
- Combat system checks for weapon children during attacks

### 2. Armor/Defense (10 upgrades) - Component Enhancement ‚úÖ

**Strategy**: Enhanced Health component with armor properties + centralized damage processing.

**Current Implemented** (4):

- Scrap Armor - Ignores first damage instance
- Spiked Vest - Reflects 1 damage back to attacker
- Ablative Plating - Absorbs first 2 damage, then provides 25% reduction
- 25% Damage Reduction - Reduces all incoming damage

**New Additions** (6):

- **Shield Generator** - Absorbs next 3 damage, then breaks (renewable on kill)
- **Reactive Plating** - Damage reduction increases with consecutive hits (25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 75%)
- **Berserker Armor** - Take 50% more damage but deal 100% more damage
- **Regenerative Mesh** - Slowly heal 1 HP every 3 seconds during combat
- **Mirror Armor** - 100% reflect damage but you take 50% of reflected amount
- **Proximity Barrier** - Reduce damage from enemies within melee range by 40%

**Implementation**:

- Enhanced `Health` component with armor properties
- New `sys_health` system for centralized damage processing
- Damage accumulation pattern (systems write to `PendingDamage[]`)
- Armor effects stack multiplicatively

### 3. Abilities (10 upgrades) - System Integration & Event Hooks

**Strategy**: New components for ability tracking + system modifications for ability effects.

**Passive Abilities** (6):

- **Ricochet** - Bullets bounce once off arena walls
- **Shadow Trail** - Movement leaves damaging trail behind you
- **Piercing Shots** - Projectiles go through first enemy and continue
- **Double Shot** - Fire an additional projectile with each attack
- **Vampiric** - Heal 1 HP for every 2 damage you deal
- **Phase Walk** - Brief invincibility when dashing (0.3s)

**Triggered Abilities** (4):

- **Combo Strike** - Every 3rd consecutive hit deals double damage
- **Berserker Mode** - +50% attack speed and movement when below 25% HP
- **Revenge Strike** - Next attack deals double damage after taking damage
- **Second Wind** - When reaching 1 HP, instantly heal to 50% max HP (once per fight)

**Implementation**:

- New component: `com_abilities.ts` to track active abilities
- System hooks: Check abilities in relevant systems (combat, movement, etc.)
- Event system: Use existing action dispatch for ability triggers
- New system: `sys_abilities.ts` for ability-specific logic

### 4. Traits (10 upgrades) - Combat Enhancement ‚ö°

**Strategy**: Direct combat stat modifications and behavioral changes with clear benefits.

**Speed Traits** (4):

- **Lightning Reflexes** - +50% movement speed and dash speed
- **Quick Draw** - +40% attack speed (faster weapon cooldowns)
- **Adrenaline Rush** - +30% speed when below 50% health
- **Momentum** - Speed increases with consecutive hits (+10% per hit, max 50%)

**Health Traits** (3):

- **Vitality Boost** - +3 maximum health
- **Regeneration** - Heal 1 HP every 5 seconds during combat
- **Last Stand** - Take 50% less damage when at 1 HP

**Behavior Traits** (3):

- **Berserker** - +100% aggressiveness, +50% damage, -1 max health
- **Assassin** - Lower aggressiveness but first attack each fight deals double damage
- **Brawler** - Higher aggressiveness, shorter dash range but +1 damage to melee attacks

**Implementation**:

- Direct modifications to movement speed, attack rates, health, and damage
- Clear positive effects that players can immediately feel
- Behavioral traits modify aggressiveness with tangible benefits

### 5. Companions (8 upgrades) - Cat Allies üê±

**Strategy**: All companions are cats with different colors and abilities that fight alongside the owner.

**Companion Cats** (8):

- **Mr. Black** - Most powerful, disables 2 random enemy upgrades for the fight
- **Mr. Orange** - Fast attacker, 3 HP, quick melee strikes
- **Mr. Pink** - Ranged fighter, fires small projectiles every 2 seconds
- **Mr. White** - Tank cat, 5 HP but slow, high damage attacks
- **Mr. Brown** - Support cat, heals owner for 1 HP every 4 seconds
- **Mr. Blue** - Berserker cat, gets +50% damage when below 50% HP
- **Mr. Gray** - Stealth cat, briefly goes invisible before surprise attacks
- **Mr. Red** - Sacrifice cat, explodes for 4 damage when killed

**Cat Mechanics**:

- Each cat has unique personality traits (Aggressiveness/Patience)
- Cats inherit team allegiance from their owner
- Visual distinction through color and size variations
- Cats die when owner dies or after taking their HP in damage
- Only one companion cat can be active at a time (later cats replace earlier ones)

**Implementation**:

- Extend AI system with "team" concept and cat-specific blueprints
- Companions target enemies of their owner automatically
- Special visual indicators showing ownership relationship
- Cat-specific abilities integrated into existing systems

## Upgrade Distribution Summary

**Total Upgrades: 48** (Player will see 33 out of 48 in a single run)

- **Weapons**: 10 upgrades (6 implemented + 4 new)
- **Armor/Defense**: 10 upgrades (4 implemented + 6 new)
- **Abilities**: 10 upgrades (6 passive + 4 triggered)
- **Traits**: 10 upgrades (4 speed + 3 health + 3 behavior)
- **Companions**: 8 upgrades (Mr. Black, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, etc.)

**Implementation Strategy**:

```typescript
// Updated upgrade categories (src/upgrades/types.ts)
export const enum UpgradeCategory {
    Weapon = "weapon",
    Armor = "armor",
    Ability = "ability",
    Trait = "trait",
    Companion = "companion", // Replaces "special"
}
```

**Key Design Principles**:

1. **Balanced Categories**: Each category offers different strategic approaches
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Every upgrade should feel impactful and change gameplay
3. **Synergies**: Upgrades from different categories should combine interestingly
4. **Visual Feedback**: All upgrades should have clear visual/audio indicators
5. **Cat Theme**: Companions are all cats fitting the game jam theme

## Implementation Priority

**Next Steps for Implementation:**

1. **Phase 3: Expand Trait System** (High Priority)
    - Add remaining trait upgrades to personality system
    - Implement dynamic traits (health-based, combat-based)

2. **Phase 4: Abilities System** (Medium Priority)
    - Create `com_abilities.ts` component
    - Implement passive abilities (Ricochet, Shadow Trail, etc.)
    - Add triggered abilities (Last Stand, Second Wind, etc.)

3. **Phase 5: Companion System** (Medium Priority)
    - Extend AI system with team concept
    - Create cat companion blueprints with unique abilities
    - Black Cat as most powerful companion with upgrade-disabling

4. **Phase 6: New Weapons & Armor** (Low Priority)
    - Add 4 new weapons (Chainsaw, Flamethrower, Crossbow, Boomerang)
    - Add 6 new armor types (Shield Generator, Reactive Plating, etc.)

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Weapons (6/10) and Armor (4/10) systems implemented and tested.
